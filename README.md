All the Algorithms that I've come across...


<i><b>Sorted Squared Array:<b><i>
 * An array of size n (where n >= 1) is given as input and all elements range from (-10000 to 10000)  
 each element must be squared and added to an output array that is at the end sorted.  
   
 <i><b>Diagonal Difference:<b><i>
 * A Matrix of size n * n is given as input, find the absolute value of the difference  
  between the sum of the diagonals of the matrix
  
  <i><b>Product Except Self:<b><i>  
  * An array P of integers are given as input. return an array of the products of *P* excluding *P[i]*
   
   <i><b>Jumping On Clouds:<b><i>  
  * An array C of integers (C[i] âˆŠ {0,1}) are given as input. each integer represents either a cumulus cloud (0) or  
    a thunder cloud (1). you can jump on to a cloud with a value 0, if the cloud is 1 or 2 indexes ahead.   
    there won't be consecutive 1s (thunder clouds) in the array and the array won't end in a thunder cloud (1).  
    find the minimum jumps required to reach the end of the array.
