<i><b>Sorted Squared Array:<b><i>
 * An array of size n (where n >= 1) is given as input and all elements range from (-10000 to 10000)  
 each element must be squared and added to an output array that is at the end sorted.  
   
 <i><b>Diagonal Difference:<b><i>
 * A Matrix of size n * n is given as input, find the absolute value of the difference  
  between the sum of the diagonals of the matrix
